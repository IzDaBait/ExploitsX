    : not only was the code bad, but a group claimed that this plugin is a fork of l2x9 which is absolutely false.
    : so I've done my best to remove their trash functions and replace them with more efficient functions. If you're looking
    : for l2x9core but without the backdoor or bloated stuff DM Bubba#8888 for AstatineCore, which is an ACTUAL fork of l2x9core.

 :

1.1.0zyi (UNSTABLE):
 :* 1.0.0 update passed! Thank you to everyone who previously purchased and supported the ExploitsX Journey.
 :* We are out of beta and better than ever! I hope you enjoy these new patches. Lots of changes have been
 :* : made so ensure you start your server on a whitelist (or just rename the config and let it regenerate) 
 :* : because there are a lot of reformats and changes in the config, and even a new one named config2.yml.
 :*   :	Also, going without config updates is not recommended but is now supported (it will use default values
 :*   :	if your config is out of date.)
 :
 @ a few red error bug fixes
 @ fixed a few things that didn't work in 1.16
 @ added a few catches for things that can sometimes return errors
 > tweak to lightlag detection system
 >* changed a few default values in the configuration
 +* interaction limit
 + punch limit
 + Added config update checker / guide
 + ExploitsX ghostmode added
     : for the streamer kind enough to use our plugin: thank you.
     : this was designed so that ExploitsX goes unnoticed in larger servers that
         want no branding or commands like /e. Ensure you speak to Bubba before
         enabling such a method (he will provide you with a key)
 + new config: config2.yml
 +* config update
   : version 310
     : format changes
     : a few changes
   : version 315
     : interaction limit
     : CHATPROTECT red-flag-words list is now in config2.yml
   : version 316
     : HUGE formatting change to the config
   + branding (boolean)
   - removed tick, vlkick, damage, punishment out of skylight configuration
   - removed the choice between different lightlag detection systems because
       option 2 will always be better
 + config2.yml configuration added
   : version 1
   + console-blocked-commands (stringlist)
   + player-blocked-commands (stringlist)
   + op-whitelist-uuids (uuid4 stringlist)
   + enable-op-whitelist (boolean)
   + ExploitsX ghost mode (object: boolean, int)
 - removed metrics (gathered RAM type [DDR4 etc...], amount [16gb etc...], and CPU status [usage report] for
     debugging purposes. I figured your privacy is more important than me knowing what kind of systems run
     ExploitsX.)
 - removed levers from the whitelist of the antiredstone (they can be spammed, unlike buttons)
 :
 : this version is unstable.
 :

0.25.2gky: [OCT 25 2020]
 - removed multithreading when teleporting players (that went badly).

0.25.1eby:
 @ fixed all the bugs present in 0.25.0aaa (probably)
 @ fixed command handle
 > modded a little bit the file saving feature on enable so it lags less and less possible errors
 + added a message if the config is out of date, and it will automatically
 		generate a new config with the configupdate.yml name so people can
 		compare the files and update it without having to reset their whole
 		file.
 > tweaked /uitem and /xitem so you don't have to include durability but it'll still work
 > fixed /e info from showing an extremely large number for max ram
 :
 : this version is stable.
 :

0.25.0aaa:
 : today we're rolling out a big update including several performance improvements, feature updates and additions,
 	 and a few changes to our systems.
 + config values added: 
 +    + enablejoinleavemsg: true
 :    :    : allows you to completely disable join or leave messages.
 +    + joinleavemsgdisable: 40
 :    :    : allows you to change at what playercount the join and leave messages stop. Set to 10000 to disable.

 ~ further 1.16 support added (not complete)
 + added /e info which displays a bit of information publicly about the server (the version, offline players, uptime, max players etc.)
 + added /uitem (OP ONLY) which spawns an item that you can place unlimited amount of times. Only works for OPs, just for testing purposes.
 > updated /xitem (OP ONLY) which spawns a shulker box filled with items (made for book restriction tests but now should work better)
 > Updated shulker box checking so light gray shulker boxes are checked
 :    : They previously were checked but a bit buggy because they are named "SILVER_SHULKER_BOX" instead of "LIGHT_GRAY_SHULKER_BOX" by the spigot system.
 :    :    : ^ fixed now.
 > Updated anti-bookban
 > Updated anti-chunkban

           extremely unstable. (Compared to max of 80%+ loss)
 > big change to the TPS calculation system. it now counts the exact ticks in the last
       moment. Added a configuration option if you want to modify the TPS too (if you're feeling a bit cheaty)
